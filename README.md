# Google-Drive-API



    Hello, and welcome to my final project. A few things to take into account before reviewing my app:



    -    you may need to install google client library:
         pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client google-auth-httplib2 google-auth-oauthlib
         
    -    you will launch "drive_app.py"
    
    -    you should sign out of all google accounts in your browser,
         except the testing account provided below

    -    When the app runs through the OAuth flow, use these credentials:
         USERNAME: service account
         PASSWORD: 

      
    Enjoy!
